<p> Ramen is an easy, quick-cooking meal perfect for those on the go or college students who are busy studying. While it is affordable, it is not very nutritious, and some people may find it tasteless, while others find the noodles too mushy. Fortunately, there are several tricks you can do to ensure that the noodles come out perfect. You can also add lots of other flavors and toppings, besides the flavoring packet that's included. With a little bit of creativity, you can have a tastier and more nutritious meal in no time!</p>

  <p> Gently press down on the noodles with a chopstick or a wooden spoon so that they sink into the water. You may have to hold them down for a little bit. Do not break the noodles in half or stir them. They will separate on their own.[4]
You can also cook the noodles separately in a pot of boiling water.</p>

<h2> Step 5: Cook the noodles for about 2 minutes</h2>
